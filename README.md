# Pizza Shop

A pizza ordering system that students can use to conveniently order pizza from SunDevil Pizza (a fake pizza store).

A user of this application can be one of three types: a Student, an Order Processor, or a Chef.

Students can make and track the status of orders. 

Order Processors can decide whether or not to accept any order, track the status of orders, and collect payment. 

Chef users confirm the status of each order during each stage of the cooking process.

This system can be used by a small pizza business to manage orders.

The project is currently deployed to [pizza-shop-team19.herokuapp.com](https://pizza-shop-team19.herokuapp.com/).
